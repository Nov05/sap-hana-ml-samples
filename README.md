# hana-ml-samples description
This project provides code examples for SAP HANA Predictive and Machine Learning scenarios and is educational content. It covers simple Predictive Analysis Library SQL examples as well as complete SAP HANA design-time  “ML scenario”-application content or HANA-ML Python Notebook examples.

# Requirements
In order to "run" the provided sample codes, a SAP HANA database environment is required with the AFL-component installed, which includes the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL). Specific sample files will specify additional requirements if required.

# Download and Installation
The sample files can be downloaded and used within the respective user / developer environment, e.g. SQL files may be opened and used within the SQL console of SAP HANA Studio or SAP HANA Database Explorer. The sample files don't require a install step for themselves, they are simply downloaded and then opened in the respective editor.
